# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Prompts:
- Add two parameters:
add two parameters names minBranchOffset and MaxBranchOffset in the TreeWidget that change corresponding useStates in RotatingCube. Both parameters shall range from 0.0 to 1.0. Both shall default to 1.0. These two parameter shall also be added to the Treestructure and passed in where the TreeStructure is create

- add single parameter
add a parameter named branchSegments in the TreeWidget that changes the corresponding useStates in RotatingCube. The parameter shall range from 4.0 to 32.0. It shall default to 8.0. The parameter shall also be added to the Treestructure and passed in where the TreeStructure is created. The parameter shall be added to the dependency list of the useEffect.

Run Project:
